title: Basics of Statistical Programming and Data Manipulation (36)
weight: 2
disableToc: true
---

This chapter is a basic introduction to statistical programming as well as a short brush-up on data more generally. For some, this will be "old news", but many will certainly benefit from reviewing this material. Afterwards, we introduces some fundamental concepts of data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
