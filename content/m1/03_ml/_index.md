This chapter introduces you to the intuition behind unsupervised (UML) and supervised machine (SML) learning, and demonstrates common techniques and workflows. It contrasts UML (=trained on labeled data) with SML (trained on labeled data), and also distinguishes it from traditional inferential statistics (e.g. econometrics).
