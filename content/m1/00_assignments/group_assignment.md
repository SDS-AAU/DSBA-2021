## DSBA 2021 - M2: (Mandatory) Assignment


## Introduction

xxxxx

Now it is time to bring most these steps together and apply them to a setting that you find interesting. This should apply the following tasks. 

- Identify an interesting problem that can be tackled using netork analysis and NLP techniques. 
- Optimally, this is done within one dataset. However, the assignment can also be done using 2 different datasets, if nothing suitable combinging both elements of netork analysis and NLP is found.
- Select and obtain relevant data to do so. 
- Clean and manipulate the data to make it useful for netork analysis and NLP techniques. 
- xxx 
- Document your workflow in a reconstructable manner. 
- Report your findings in an accessible manner. 


## Task description

You have the choice between two different assignments:

1. Find and select datasets on your own, and perform an interesting and informative analysis using the elements stated above on your own.
2. Solve both exercise 1 and 2 sepperately, using the corresponding dataset and following the stated tasks accordingly.

### Data & Problem identification


In this exercise, you are asked to choose and obtain a dataset you consider interesting and appropriate for the tasks required. Some of you may already have some ideas about interesting datasets. There are many open datasets available on the internet (e.g. kaggle or individual projects like Stanford Open Policing or download some of the Datacamp project datasets) [here a recent list of open data repositories for inspiration](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-sourcesfor-machine-learning-datasets-bb6d0dc3378b)

If you instead want to collect your data (e.g. scraping Twitter or other platforms) â€“ we will not hold you back. However, consider the timeframe. 


**The data should fulfill the following minimum requirements:**

### Analysis pipeline

The analysis to be carried out by you has to contain elements of data **nedtwork analysis and natural language processing.**

- xxxx



### Documentation and Deliverables

You are asked to hand in a **well commented functional computational notebook**

#### Computational Notebook

The notebook targets a machine-learning literate audience. Here you can go deeper into the technical details and method considerations. Provide thorough documentation of the whole process, the used methods. Describe the intuition behind the selected and used methods, justify choices made, and interpret results.

Please provide the notebook as a PDF.


## Finally

-  Submission deadline is **20.10, 23:59** - on peergrade (class code: N8A46K)
-  Peer Feedback deadline is **25.10, 23:59** - PRovide constructive comments as you would like to recieve them
-  In case of trouble/issues/questions, please write on Teams.
