## Workshop: AI as a Service

By guest: Andreas Markussen 

### Introduction 

The purpose is to demonstrate a minimum viable product of an ML model deployment. Keeping with the DSBA spirit, I would keep the section hands-on. I would cover a minimal ML pipeline using data that is already preprocessed. The model will be saved to a static file and served through an API. When done, we will have created a web service from scratch, that can be used by any user in their browser. The project will be conducted in Python, with a little HTML added.


### Structure:

- Very brief introduction to how the web works - 15 mins
- Building model and exporting to static file - 15 mins
- Building Flask web app - 10 mins
- Adding APIs - 10 mins
- Adding some HTML and concluding the complete web service - 10 mins
- Deployment to Heroku free account, short showcase of extensions and other applications (no code here) and rounding off - 15 mins

### Preperation

To get most of this workshop, you should have: 

- Some existing knowledge of Python
- A local installation of Python
- Good understanding of an ML flow.
- No understanding of the web in general
