The corresponding Aalborg University Moodle course page can be found [here](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=39082). Note that this page rather than Moodle will represent the central hub for teaching material. At SDS we believe in the power of open science and open education. Following AAU’s “Knowledge for the world” strategy, we make all our material available outside password protected university systems.
