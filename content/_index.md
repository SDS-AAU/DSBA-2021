# Data Science for Business Applications 2021

## CBS - Digi

Welcome to the "Data Science for Business Analytics" page. Throughout this course, you will aquire skills, knowledge, and capabilities to navigate and actively participate in the application of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques in business. We hope you are excited.

Note that this page rather than Canvas will represent the central hub for teaching material. At DSBA we believe in the power of open science and open education, and consequently we make all our material available outside password protected university systems.

The corresponding canvas course page can be found [here](https://cbscanvas.instructure.com/courses/11902), and will not be updated for other things than providing the live-lecture calendar.
