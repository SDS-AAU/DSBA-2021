Data: The data is to be found at: https://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/tree/master/00_data/network_krackhard (Hint: You neet to download the raw data) Data: What do I get? Background Let the fun begin. You will analyze network datacollected from the managers of a high-tec company. This dataset, originating from the paper below, is widely used in research on organizational networks.</description></item><item><title>Exercise t 2 - NLP</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/m2/00_assignments/exercise2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/m2/00_assignments/exercise2/</guid><description>Introduction: Building a Hate Speech Classifier This assignment is less structured than previous individual assignments.
You are given a collection of approximately 25k tweets that have been manually (human) annotated. class denotes: 0 - hate speech, 1 - offensive language, 2 - neither

1. Preprocessing and vectorizaion. Justify your choices and explain possible alternatives (e.g. removing stopwords, identifying bi/tri-grams, removing verbs or use of stemming, lemmatization etc.)
Create a bag-of-words representation, apply TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction (LSA-topic modelling alternatively simply PCA or SVD) to transform your corpus into a feature matrix.</description></item><item><title>M1 (Mandatory) Assignment</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/m2/00_assignments/group_assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/m2/00_assignments/group_assignment/</guid><description>DSBA 2021 - M1: (Mandatory) Assignment Introduction With the individual assignments, you already performed most of the steps in a typical machine learning pipeline. You imported some data, cleaned it, explored the variables and their relationships using summary statistics and visualisations. You also exercised some standard machine learning preprocessing procedures such as feature scaling and dealing with missing values.
You practised unsupervised machine learning techniques for dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) and clustering (e.</description></item></channel></rss>
