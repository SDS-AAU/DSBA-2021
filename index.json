The second part of the warmup provides an overview of the infrastructure used at SDS.\nData Science in Business In this chapter you learn about data science and ML applications in business applications. The presentations have been recorded as part of a workshop on Data Science for Business Leaders. Contents are not part of the course curriculum, yet a good way to get more familiar with teminology.\n Data Science in business I-III Slides  Introduction to the Data Science Ecosystem Overview of software, platforms and most other things you are going to work with at SDS.

Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.\nM3: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics Introduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.\nM4: Capstone Project  Submission ~8/1 2022 Requirements  "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m1/02_basics/01_stat_prog_r/","title":"Statistical programming - R","tags":[],"description":"","content":"      Open in Colab\n   HTML Notebook\n    "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/m1/01_warmup/03_business3/","title":"Data Science in business III - Team &amp; Roles","tags":[],"description":"","content":"   "},{"uri":"https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-2021/info/04_litetrature/","title":"Literature &amp; Resources","tags":[],"description":"","content":"While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.
