This session is a basic introduction to statistical programming as well as a short brush-up on data more generally. For some, this will be &amp;ldquo;old news&amp;rdquo;, but many will certainly benefit from reviewing this material. We start with a generall theory lecture on data structures and properties, and then dive into R and Python specific applications of statistical programming.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/01_infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/01_infrastructure/</guid><description>Main Infrastructure MS teams : Join our MS our teams channel to get updates from us, Q&amp;amp;A, and talk to your peers.

This session introduces some fundamental concepts of data manipulation and Exploratory Data Analysis. We will again start with a theoretical lecture on fundamental concepts and techniques in data manipulation, and afterwards again explore them in R and Python specific applications. These applications are complemented by recap exercises to test yourself.

M1: Applied Data Science and Machine Learning This module will prove a condensed introduction to the “Data Science Pipeline”, introducing students to methods, techniques, and workflows in applied data analytics and machine learning, including data acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization, and communication.
M2: Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing Focuses on analyzing a variety of unstructured data sources. Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.</description></item><item><title>Literature &amp; Resources</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/04_litetrature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/04_litetrature/</guid><description>While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version. We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.
Main Literature These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using R and Python.</description></item><item><title>Semester Schedule</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/03_schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/03_schedule/</guid><description>M1: Week 36-38 Topics W 36: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization W 37: Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML), Supervised Machine Learning (SML) W 38: Workshop &amp;amp; project work M2: Week 39-41 Topics W 39: Introduction to Network Analysis W 40: Introduction to Natural-Language-Processing (NLP) W 41: Workshop &amp;amp; project work M3: Week 43-46 Topics W 43: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) &amp;amp; Deep Learning (DL) W 44: Neural networks for spatial data: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) W 45: Neural Networks for sequential data: Recurrent Neural networks (RNN &amp;amp; LSTM) W 46: Workshop &amp;amp; project work Key Dates In-person workshops on CBS campus (always Thursday + Friday)</description></item><item><title>Final Project Requirements</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/05_requirements_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/info/05_requirements_project/</guid><description>To be updated soon</description></item><item><title>The Data Science Ecosystem</title><link>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/m1/01_warmup/02_ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sds-aau.github.io/DSBA-2021/m1/01_warmup/02_ecosystem/</guid><description> Use the tabs to access content
